    Home Connect API

    This API provides access to home appliances enabled by Home Connect (https://home-connect.com). Through the API programs can be started and stopped, or home appliances configured and monitored. For instance, you can start a cotton program on a washer and get a notification when the cycle is complete.

In order to use this API in your own client, you need an OAuth 2 client implementing the authorization code grant flow (https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/authorization/flow).
